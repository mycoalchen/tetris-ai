Greedily select the best move by maximizing a rating function given the board state after the next two moves.
Features/weights:
- Pile height (-62709)
- Holes (-30271)
- Connected Holes (0)
- Removed Lines (-48621)
- Altutide Difference (35395)
- Max Well Depth (-12)
- Sum of all Wells (-43810)
- Landing Height (0)
- Blocks (0)
- Weighted Blocks (-4041)
- Row Transitions (-44262)
- Column Transitions (-5832)
These parameters seem suspect as the weight for removed lines should certainly be positive while the weight for altutide difference should certainly be negative. It seems like there was a mistake in either the feature order or the weight order.
